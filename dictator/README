This code gives the JAVA implementation of the Greedy Dictator algorithm given by Atila  Abdulkadiroglu  and  Tayfun  Sonmez in 1998.
Their paper can be accessed at 'Random Serial Dictatorship and the Core from Random Endowments in House Allocation Problems.Econometrica, 66(3):689–701, 1998'.
The implementation is in a distributed setting where each agent is running on a separae machine. The agents don't share any memory and can only communicate with
each other through messages (implemented using JAVA RMI Interface).
The total order in distributed system is implemented using Skeen's algorithm, 'D. R. Cheriton and D. Skeen. Understanding the limitations of causally and totally
ordered communication.ACM Symp. on Operating SystemsPrinciples, 27(5):44–57, 1993.'
To run the algorithm, use the main() function in Main.java. Many examples are provided, which can be run from the main() function.
The output shows the house allocated to each agent, and the total number of messages exchanged in the system.
