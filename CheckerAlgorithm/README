This code gives the JAVA implementation of the Checker algorithm.
The implementation is in a distributed setting where each agent is running on a separate machine. The agents don't share any memory and can only communicate with
each other through messages (implemented using JAVA RMI Interface).
There are two versions of the algorithm, centralised and distributed.
In the centralisedChecker, there is a special checker process.
In the distributedChecker, each agent becomes the checker process, whenever required by the algorithm.
To run the algorithm, use the main() function in Main.java. Many examples are provided, which can be run from the main() function.
The output shows the house allocated to each agent, and the total number of messages exchanged in the system.
