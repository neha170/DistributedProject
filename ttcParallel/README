This code gives the JAVA implementation of the TTC algorithm.
The implementation is in a parallel setting where each agent is running on a separate thread. The agents communicate with each other using shared memory.
This is a parallel implementation of the algorithm proposed by Xiong Zheng and Vijay Garg in 2019.
Their paper can be accessed at 'Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for the Housing Allocation Problem, 2019.'
This implementation uses the deterministic way of labelling an agent as active or not.
Details of this algorithm can be found at 'Richard Cole and Uzi Vishkin. Deterministic coin tossing with applications to optimal parallel list ranking. Information and Control,70(1):32â€“53, 1986'.
To run the algorithm, use the main() function in Main.java. Many examples are provided, which can be run from the main() function.
The output shows the house allocated to each agent.
